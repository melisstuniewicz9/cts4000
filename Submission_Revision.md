### Abstract
Paws and Hearts is a community-driven minimal computing project that presents a collection of stories and photographs highlighting the mental health and wellness benefits of pet ownership. With stories sent in by real individuals, each contribution is raw and authentic, helping to create a wholesome online space where vulnerability is encouraged. Enhanced by original illustrations and guided by web design and user experience principles, it stands as an online space that seamlessly blends scholarly research and creativity, presenting a potentially sensitive subject matter into a visually immersive digital format.    

 - *very compelling, and atratcs the reader to want to continue*

- *i think you were supposed to take a section from your webite and try to encode in in markdown with photos and links embeded, not just a link*
-  *the webiste and blogs themselves are well done and have an an appealing layout*
-  *I'm a fan of the original art work you made for the project*
-  *The links work fine but the work itself isn't in markdown*
-  *headers are a good size to break up work*
-  *I like the inclusion of the section breaks, makes differnt segments clear*

**My Reflection:**

**Communication, style and polish**

When creating Paws and Hearts this summer in CTS3030, I wanted to ensure that all corresponding written pieces were extremely high quality and competent gramatically. Given Gabby's score of 5/5 in the communication section, I am pleased that my efforts were acknowledged. Aditionally, she found my abstract to be engaging, prompting further curiosity in readers, so I feel as if no modifications are needed here. 

**Relevance to special issue theme**

I feel as if the relevance to issue theme is somewhat subjective. While Gabby did not feel as if my project was a good fit for the journal, I received positive feedback from the editorial team. Despite my submission being accepted, these contrasting perspectives have left me somewhat unsure about how to edit this submission and how explicitly I should emphasize its thematic connections. After reviewing the CFP once more, I think Paws and Hearts works well in the area of mixed media work (see below) so I feel comfortable in my decision to submit to the journal as well as the justification I provided for why exactly it fits. 

![CFP2025](SubmissionReviewSS.png) 

Of course, I am always receptive to constructive feedback, so If I am ever in a postion to submit academic work for a different journal during my undergraduate journey, I will make sure to submit something that aligns more closely with the themes vision!

**Overall originality, creativity, and strength of ideas**

I received mostly positive feedback here. Gabby enjoyed navigating my website and appreciated the original artwork, but she mentioned that she has come across research projects with a similar concept (the impacts of pet ownership on mental health). I think this is why a point was deducted from the score. This is a fair judgment because I am definitely not the only one who has created a gallery of pet photos and testimonials. However, the project was never meant to be a completely original concept. It was meant to be a passion project that showcased my artwork and shared uplifting stories about pets and their owners. In fact, part of the research process involved finding similar projects and using them as inspiration for our own work, so I do not want it to appear as though I set out to create something revolutionary.

Here's an example of a cool digital project that I took great inspiration from! (See the gallery section.) 

https://www.the-petproject.com/about-1

This project was inspired by my own pet’s role in helping me navigate a grief journey, and I am extremely proud of the work I produced. I understand that it will not resonate with everyone, and that is completely okay. For that reason, I do not plan to make any major edits to the project.

**Accuracy and completion of markdown code**

My lowest score lies in the "accuracy and completion of markdown code section." The main piece of feedback here was in regards to my project not being properly encoded in markdown. Unfortunately, you cannot use embeds in GitHub markdown, so providing the Neocities link where my project is hosted was the only realistic way my project could be viewed. That being said, I most definitely could have encoded my reflection blog post in markdown. I had thought about doing so initially, but because of the piece being over 2000 words (and several images) I was worried that it would would cause clutter, and be a labour intensive provess for the editorial team. This is why I decided to simply link the blog post in my submission. I remain confident in my decision to take this approach, so I won't be making any modifications at this time. 

![Length of reflection blog post](SS2.png)

I wanted to quickly address my citations list. From my understanding, the use of footnotes was a suggestion, and not a requirment. To be fully transparent, I am not too confident in Chicago style citations, and have mostly worked with APA format during my undergraduate degree. I did make an effort to change my APA bibliography into a Chicago Style one prior to sending it over to Gabby, but I did not include footnotes due to lack of experience. This is definiely a wake up call, as I likely should demonstrate competency in MLA, APA and Chicago style, so I will make sure to experiment with this citation method in the future. I'm thankful this was brought to my attention (especially since I am keen on pursuing graduate studies.) Gabby also noted that the header image that I inserted of my website banner, was not available for her to view as I had not shared the entire repository in which the image was stored with her alongside my submission file. That was most certianly an oversight on my part! I'm glad this was brought to my attention, so I can fix this error for when this assigment is being graded and you can see all the screenshots!

While Gabby mentioned that my metadata was done well, I received feedback from the editorial team that I should include a short biography within my submission. I had left this out initially because I was unsure whether my project would be selected, and I did not want to overload the submission with unnecessary detail until I knew it would be worthwhile. I will update my submission review to include some basic information about myself, such as my program, my interest in the intersection of scholarly research and creativity, and my passion for experiencing learning through non-traditional, more immersive digital formats.

### Abstract
Paws and Hearts is a community-driven minimal computing project that presents a collection of stories and photographs highlighting the mental health and wellness benefits of pet ownership. With stories sent in by real individuals, each contribution is raw and authentic, helping to create a wholesome online space where vulnerability is encouraged. Enhanced by original illustrations and guided by web design and user experience principles, it stands as an online space that seamlessly blends scholarly research and creativity, presenting a potentially sensitive subject matter into a visually immersive digital format.

### Why it Works with the Theme:

Scholarly research can take many forms beyond traditional academic papers. This digital project blends visual arts and academia, showing that tangible evidence of learning does not have to be monotonous or devoid of personality and fun. Using digital tools, including a static website built with Jekyll that I took great part in programming, this work repurposes a qualitative dataset into something expressive and emotionally engaging. It provides a more immersive and creative way of experiencing knowledge, which I feel really emboides digital humanities scholarship.
