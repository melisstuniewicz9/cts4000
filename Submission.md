### Abstract
*Paws and Hearts* is a static website showcasing a gallery of images and testimonials about the mental health and wellness benefits that result from pet ownership. With stories sent in by real individuals, each contribution is raw and authentic, helping to create a wholesome online space where vulnerability is encouraged.  

The project seamlessly blends scholarly research and creativity by presenting a potentially sensitive subject matter in a visually immersive digital format. Enhanced by original artwork and guided by web design and user experience principles, it stands as an online space that proudly reflects its creatorâ€™s labor of love and passion for creativity.
