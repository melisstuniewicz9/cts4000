With stories sent in by real individuals, each contribution is raw and authentic, helping to create a wholesome online space where vulnerability is encouraged. Enhanced by original illustrations and guided by web design and user experience principles, it stands as an online space that seamlessly blends scholarly research and creativity, presenting a potentially sensitive subject matter into a visually immersive digital format.
